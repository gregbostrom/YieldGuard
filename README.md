# YieldGuard
YieldGuard is a MOVE language smart contract which allows for storing anonymous encrypted data on chain.

YieldGuard was develop during the PermissionLess III Hackathon October 7 & 8, 2024.

It's mission is to provide Apple farmers a way to anonymously submit their encrypted crop growing data to store on chain.

Later, Multi-Party Computation (MPC) methods could then be used to aggregate the data for analytics keeping the original farmers anonymous.

YieldGuard is just one piece of the system.
